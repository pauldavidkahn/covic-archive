Type of Visualization,Line Charts,,Line Chart,,Chart displaying information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. Lines for multiple data series are used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.
Type of Visualization,,,Area Chart,,Chart that fills the area between a line and an axis as a color or texture; used to display the development of quantitative values over an interval or time period.
Type of Visualization,,,Stacked Area Chart,,Area Graphs that use multiple data series that start each point from the point left by the previous data series.
Type of Visualization,,,Stream graph,,"A variation of a Stacked Area Graph where values are displaced around a varying central baseline. Stream Graphs display the changes in data over time of different categories through the use of flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-like stream."
Type of Visualization,,,Slope Chart,,A line chart that displays exactly two points in time on the same scale where the slope of the line illustrates the change from Time A to Time B.

Type of Visualization,,,Treemap or Tree Diagram,,"Displays hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles, which parts combined, make a larger rectangle or as a branching tree. Use to compare sizes between groups and single elements nested in them, or as an alternative to pie graphs with a higher number of categories."
Type of Visualization,,,Scatterplot,,"A graph of plotted points that show the relationship between two sets of data. Due to its particular structure, itâ€™s able to display a big amount of data. Uses to identify patterns, clusters of elements, and to make outliers values stand out."
Type of Visualization,,,Network,,A graph where nodes are connected and positioned depending on their mutual relationship. Used to identify clusters in large and complex relationship data set.
Type of Visualization,,,Bubble Chart,,"A chart using circles proportional to a data value to show relationships among categories or groups, avoiding any kind of axis."
Type of Visualization,,,Flow Chart,,A chart used to show different behaviors among multiple steps and situations.
Type of Visualization,,,Sankey Chart,,A type of flow diagram in which the width of the arrows or lines connecting two or more nodes are proportional to a quantity.
Type of Visualization,,,Heatmap,,Heatmap is a data matrix visualizing values in the cells by the use of a color gradient. Represents mutual correlations of variables within a data set.
Type of Visualization,,,Isotype,,"A method of showing social, technological, biological, and historical connections in visual form through repetition of pictogram units based on concepts developed by Otto Neurath and the work of the Isotype Institute"
Type of Visualization,,,Gauge Chart,,A chart using a needle against a round or semi-circular dial to display a single value within a range
Type of Visualization,,,Radar,,Chart used to represent values of multiple indicators simultaneously through distances from a central point. Connecting these points creates a pattern representing proportional quantities.
Type of Visualization,Illustration Diagram,,Scientific illustration,,"Illustration meant to convey scientific data, where the drawing corresponds as closely as possible to human anatomy, virus structure, biological process, airflow physics, etc. "
Type of Visualization,,,Instructional graphic,,"Illustration meant to instruct reader in a process or  behavior such as social distancing, hand washing, making or handling a mask, etc."

Article Technique,Scrollytelling,,,,"Scrollytelling or Parallax scrolling is an HTML technique that animates, reveals or hides content on the screen as the user scrolls a page in the browser."
Visual Techniques,Small Multiples,,,,"Visualizations include multiples of variations on a single subject, such as the same value for many countries, cities, states, arranged in a row or a grid"
Visual Techniques,Animating,,Time-series animation,,Animation that visualizes changes to a variable in a time series
Visual Techniques,,,Transition animation,,Animation of transitions that are bound to data: the view changes because a variable in the data or metadata change.
Visual Techniques,,,Educational animation,,Animated sequence that explain complex ideas through a series of images
Interaction Techniques,Navigating,,,,"Position, magnify or reduce a view of a visualization"
Interaction Techniques,Brushing and Linking,,,,"Brushing (selecting a subset of the data items with an input device) one portion of a visualization that is linked corresponding changes in another part, showing how a point, or set of points, behaves in each of the plots."
Interaction Techniques,Filtering,,,,"Filter(s) enable users to change the set of data items being presented based on some specific conditions, so that only data items meeting those criteria are presented."
